SOM
===
Classes, utilities and everything else useful to common development efforts at [Software Marbles](http://softwaremarbles.com).

SOM is from **SO**ftware **M**arbles but it also means [catfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish) in my [native language](http://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barski_som). My primary school was on the riverbank of [Danube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) and I would daily pass by catfish swimming in local market aquariums.
